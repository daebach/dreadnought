Miscellaneous
=========

The Miscellaneous commands are just randoms that I will be including that do not fit particularly into any field pertaining to aethercrafting. 
They might include certain "other aspects" to be used elsewhere, if you please.

Commands
--------

- `DREAD VERSION` `DREADNOUGHT VERSION` `DVERSION` -- All three commands will display which version you currently have installed. Use whichever you wish.
